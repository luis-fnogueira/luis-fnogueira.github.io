## Welcome to my page!

I am Luis Nogueira, I was born in Jundia√≠/SP in Brazil and I work as a People Analytics Analyst since June 2022. You can find my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/luis-fnogueira/) here. Feel free to contact me!

I have a background in logistics and HR. I have worked in transportation, supplies, onboarding (of employees) and always have sought to use data to improve company's performance. Then I decided to become a data analyst and started to study Python, SQL and different data visualization softwares, such as Power BI.
